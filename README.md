# WarGame

This project contains fundamentals of programming in the little WarGame.
1. There are generals with posibilities to recruit soldiers, attack other general or promote their soldiers.
2. There is always one observer who keeps everything in his storybook - some logger.
3. Soldiers have their own statistics and their price like:
	- health point
	- experience
	- ranks
	- strenght
4. When Soldier's experience is risen to 5 they gain promotion
5. When Soldier's hp falls down to 0, they die.
6. Attacks are performed by army to army. When army dies, General dies too.
